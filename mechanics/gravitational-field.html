    <h1>Gravitational Field</h1>

    <h2>Definition of Gravitational Field</h2>
<p>
  The gravitational field <strong>g</strong> at a point in space is defined as the gravitational force <em>per unit mass</em> experienced by a small test mass placed at that point:
</p>
<div class="formula-box">
  \[
  \mathbf{g} = \frac{\mathbf{F}}{m} = G \frac{M}{r^2} \hat{r}
  \]
</div>

<p>
  Where:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>\( \mathbf{g} \) is the gravitational field vector at distance \( r \) from the mass \( M \)</li>
    <li>\( \mathbf{F} \) is the gravitational force on the test mass \( m \)</li>
    <li>\( G \) is the universal gravitational constant</li>
    <li>\( \hat{r} \) is a unit vector pointing from \( M \) toward the test mass (direction of the field)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<!-- Inserted explanation -->
<p>
  The reason the gravitational field is defined as <em>force per unit mass</em> is to separate the effect of the source mass from the test mass. When you place any small object in the gravitational field created by a large mass \( M \), the force it experiences depends on its own mass \( m \). To understand the nature of the gravitational influence itself — independent of which object you place there — physicists define the <strong>gravitational field</strong> as the force that would act on a mass of exactly 1 kilogram.
</p>
<p>
  This makes <strong>gravitational field strength</strong> a property of the space around the source mass, not a property of the object experiencing the force. Once the field \( \mathbf{g} \) is known, you can find the force on any mass \( m \) by simply multiplying: \( \mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{g} \).
</p>
<p>
  This concept is similar to defining electric field in electromagnetism, where the field describes how a charge would be influenced independent of the test charge’s magnitude.
</p>

    <h2>Physical Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
      The gravitational field represents the influence that a mass \( M \) exerts on the space around it. Any other mass placed in this field experiences a force proportional to its mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike force, the gravitational field is <em>independent</em> of the test mass placed in the field. It depends only on the source mass \( M \) and the distance \( r \).
    </p>
    <p>
      At Earth's surface, the gravitational field strength is approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{N/kg} \), which corresponds to the familiar acceleration due to gravity \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
    </p>

    <h2>Vector Nature of Gravitational Field</h2>
    <p>
      The gravitational field is a vector field. This means at every point in space, it has both magnitude and direction:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> Decreases with the square of the distance \( r \) from the source mass.</li>
      <li><strong>Direction:</strong> Always points <em>towards</em> the source mass \( M \), indicating gravity is always attractive.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When multiple masses are present, the total gravitational field at a point is the <em>vector sum</em> of the fields from each mass.
    </p>

    <h2>Gravitational Field Lines</h2>
    <p>
      Gravitational field lines provide a visual way to understand the field's direction and strength:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Field lines point inward, toward the mass creating the field.</li>
      <li>The density of the field lines represents the magnitude of the field; closer lines mean stronger gravity.</li>
      <li>Lines never cross because the gravitational field at a point has a unique direction.</li>
      <li>The pattern is spherically symmetric for a point mass or a spherical mass distribution.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These lines help explain how objects move under gravity and how the force varies in space.
    </p>

    <h2>Why the Gravitational Field Concept is Useful</h2>
    <p>
      Using the gravitational field allows us to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculate gravitational forces on any mass without recalculating source mass effects repeatedly.</li>
      <li>Analyze motion in systems with multiple masses by adding fields vectorially.</li>
      <li>Understand gravity as a property of space around a mass, rather than just a force acting at a distance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Calculate the gravitational field strength \( g \) at a distance of 10,000 km from Earth's center. Earth's mass is \( 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \).
    </p>
    <div class="formula-box">
      \[
      g = G \frac{M}{r^2} = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \times \frac{5.97 \times 10^{24}}{(1 \times 10^{7})^2} = 3.98 \, \text{m/s}^2
      \]
    </div>
    <p>
      This means the gravitational field strength (and acceleration due to gravity) is weaker at this altitude than at Earth's surface.
    </p>

    <h2 class="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The gravitational field \( \mathbf{g} \) is the gravitational force per unit mass experienced by a test mass placed near a source mass. It is a vector field that decreases in magnitude with the square of the distance and points toward the source mass. Understanding gravitational fields helps predict forces and motions in multi-body systems and provides a foundation for more advanced physics concepts.
